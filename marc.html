    <h3>About me</h3>
<p>My name is Marc Espel Gutierrez, I was born on the 1 of February 2012 In Quincy-Sous-Senart, Paris, France. I am 13 years old, I have an older brother who is 25 years old and still lives in France. After I was born, I lived for three years in Montgeron (a city in France near Paris) and then came to live here in México because a big part of my family lives here. However, I do have cousins, aunts and uncles and a grandma in Europe.</p>

<h3>Where do I study?</h3>
<p>I currently study at <a class="aesthetic" href="https://www.churchill.edu.mx/">The Churchill School</a> , I am in my 1st year of Secondary, and I have a lot of friends. One of my best friends is JP, also known as panda, you can see that he is also in this team too.</p>

<h3>Hobbies and likes</h3>
<p>My hobbies are playing video games and playing Football. I support <a class="aesthetic" href="https://www.fcbarcelona.es/es/">Fc Barclona</a>. I currently have no pets but I would like to someday have a fish and I would like to name it tipi. I like to eat, especially asian food, and good meat. My favourite restaurants are: <a class="aesthetic" href="https://toritori.com.mx/"> "Tori Tori" </a>, “Fogo de Chao”, “El Japonez”,  “La tonina”,  “Shake Shack”, etc.</p>
