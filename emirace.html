      <h3>Who I am</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Emiliano Vera Chavero, and I live in Mexico City. I’ve lived here all my life with my parents, Carlos Vera and Laura Chavero. I go to <a class="aesthetic" href="https://www.churchill.edu.mx/">The Churchill School</a> and I’ve been there since I was a little kid. It’s the place where I’ve learned a lot and made great memories.</p>

<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>One thing you should know about me is that I really love sports  especially basketball. I started playing when I was 12, and since then, I’ve fallen in love with the game. It’s not just a hobby anymore, it’s something I’m super passionate about. I practiced a lot, and thanks to that, I made it to the top 10 basketball players in Mexico City for my age group. That made me really proud!</p>

<h3>Special moments</h3>
<p>One of my favorite moments was when my team won the regional 3x3 FIBA OPEN Tournament. It was a big competition with really strong teams, so winning felt amazing. It helped me become a better player and a better teammate too.</p>

<h3>Likes</h3>
<p>I’ve also tried other sports, and they’ve helped me stay active and focused. But nothing beats basketball for me. I love how fast it is, how you have to think quickly, and how important teamwork is. And honestly, it’s just really fun to play!</p>

<p>When I’m not playing, I like watching games too. I’m a huge fan of <a class="aesthetic" href="https://www.fcbarcelona.es/es/">Fc Barclona</a> and the <a class="aesthetic" href="https://www.instagram.com/warriors/">Golden State Warriors</a>. I think their style and energy are awesome, and I look up to a lot of their players.</p>

<p>Basketball has taught me a lot — not just about playing, but about working hard, not giving up, and believing in myself. I think that’s the coolest part.</p>
